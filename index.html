<!-- Yes, I was a programmer in a big project, really big
but I don't know what difference is between margin and padding
such as a...
 -->

<!--so this difference is that: padding coming with border or a background or any box, with out those we have margin
then margin is for outside of a some box and border is for content of a box 
ok, I try for some way and I check them in browser console
so the important note is that browser set default margin and padding so we should ignore them by set zero for them in anywhere
actually I can see default margin in console but not yet for padding-->
